I have tried to implement a lenders borrowers system via this cpp program with various fuctionalities such as entering name of lender and borrower, unique used id for lender, the time for which loan is required by borrower, the amount which is needed, at the lender's end we can see how many total borrowers are there 

We can also calculate the delay in payment of loans and we can see total time taken by borrower for loan payment.

I have tried to implement all the 4 pillars of OOP's via my code which are: polymorphism,abstraction,encapsulation and lastly inheritance.


For the 2nd part: 

My program is Centralized:


Demerits of being centralized are:

1)Lack of indepenence: Cnetralized lending resources are affected by external circumstances and hence may not take decisions best suited for the interest of use in 
every case.
2)Slow Decision Making: As we have to move through hierarchy.
3)Decision are based on opinion and feeling of the top group and hence view of masses is not reflected in decision making.
